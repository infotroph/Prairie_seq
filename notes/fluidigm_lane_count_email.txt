Hi Scott,

In the end we did the 2 step amplification and used the following primers:
V4
ITS3-ITS4
18S
NS31-AML2
PlantITS2-Plant ITS4

The amplifications worked incredibly well with only 3 samples that do not show product on the Fragment analyzer. There is the potential for a LOT of sequence.  Attached are the fragment analyzer results of one of the plates.
In theory the MiSeq should be enough, however I would assume that the 18S and V4 will have a very large portion of the sequences as they both have strong peaks and are the shortest amplicons.  We ran only 3 lanes of 18S (250-300bp peak) and 6 lanes of V4  (400 bp peak) to try to offset this as much as possible.  NS31, 20 lanes; ITS3-4 12 lanes; Plant ITS 7 lanes.

Mark,

1. I took the liberty of copying Scott at his new U Arkansas email address, which is the one to use now. Scott, my apologies if you're seeing this twice.

2. I'm still working on getting the account number nailed down -- Getting lots of out-of-office messages. Will update as soon as I have it. Sorry for taking so long on that. 

3. We were wavering on the sequencing format because we seemed very near the middle of the number of reads vs. read length vs. price tradeoff; one piece of information that would help us make the final call is to know how many of the Fluidigm samples amplified successfully (more failures = fewer reads needed = MiSeq gets more attractive.) Do you know how many of the Fluidigm samples produced detectable product, or is that unknown until the sequencing results come back?

Thanks,
Chris
