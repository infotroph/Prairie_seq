Mr. Pizzo,

I'm a graduate student at the University of Illinois and I'm working on =
a project that involves the prairie plantings at the Energy Bioscience =
Institute farm. I understand that Pizzo & Associates provided the seed =
and the mycorrhizal inoculant for these plantings and I'm hoping I can =
get some more details about the inoculant. The very short version of my =
questions:=20

	* Do you know what fungal and bacterial species are present in =
your mycorrhizal inoculant mix?
	* Can you tell us anything about where this inoculant came from =
and how you produced it?
	* If the inoculant you have on hand now is similar to what you =
had in 2008, we're interested in obtaining a small sample of it.

If you don't know these yourself but know of someone else who could =
answer them, I'd appreciate you  forwarding this message to them.

Still with me? Great. Here's a more detailed explanation:

 My group is studying how the different species within a prairie =
interact or avoid each other belowground -- for example, we might very =
frequently find bluestem roots right next to rosinweed roots, or at the =
other extreme we only find one or the other in a given sample. We also =
want to ask the same question for fungi and bacteria: Since many plants =
have very specific mycorrhizal partners, we expect that the fungi we =
find in the soil around a bluestem root will be very different from the =
fungi next to a bush clover root.=20

Since it's very hard to tell tell plant species apart by their roots, =
we're taking a DNA sequencing approach to answer these questions. We =
have taken soil cores from across the prairie plots at the Energy Farm, =
divided them up by depth, separated roots from soil, extracted DNA, and =
we're now preparing to have everything sequenced. We can then match the =
sequences we see against those from known species and use that =
information to identify which species of plant, fungus, and bacteria are =
present in each of our mixed-species soil & root samples.=20

Once we know who is there, one followup question we'd love to ask is =
something like "where did the microbes come from?" Does the community we =
see look more like what was in the soil before planting, more like the =
inoculant, or does it contain species that came in from elsewhere =
without our help?=20

That's where Pizzo & Associates  comes in: Do you know what species of =
microbes you sold us in the inoculant? Note that I'm not implying you =
"should" know--whatever the mix is, the plants have been very =
successful, so it did its job! But if you *do* know what's in the mix, =
it would let us ask a very cool question, and we'd be happy to share our =
results with you so you know which species within the mix did and didn't =
stick around until year 5 after planting.

Besides species names, it would be helpful if you can tell us anything =
else about how you prepare the inoculant: Is it a mix of known species, =
or is it cultured from a native prairie soil, or some other process? Has =
your production process or source material changed since 2008? If we =
were to sequence a sample of your current stock, do you think it would =
contain the same species as the stuff we bought in 2008? If so, is there =
a chance we could obtain such a sample?

Thanks for your time. If you have other questions, let me know by email =
(black11@igb.illinois.edu) or phone (503 929-9421). I look forward to =
hearing from you.

Thanks,
Chris

Hi Chris,

Happy to help! I am glad to hear the plantings are doing well. I always see=

The inoculant was purchased from RTI. http://reforest.com/  I am copying Ne=

What else can I help with?

Subject: Fwd: Mycorrhizal inoculant details

Dear Chris,

I am happy to enlighten you to the best of my ability.  According to our
records, the inoculum that was purchased in 2008 by Pizzo and Associates
was a single species *Glomus intraradices*.  We do also offer multiple
species products so it may possibly have been a three species blend of *G
intraradices, G etunicatum and G deserticola,* but I believe it was the *G
intraradices* only.  We do not add any bacteria or other organisms to the
medium, however the culturing is done outdoors and is exposed to elements
and the messy kind of environment you find in open spaces (we believe this
adds to the conditioning of the inoculum).  We closely monitor the culture
to assure that it is pathogen and pest free.  Other than that, any microbes
that might blow in are uncontrollable and will likely become part of a food
chain.

We produce it here in California and during that time around 2008, we had
two production sites, one near Indio, CA in the Coachella Valley, Riverside
Co. for winter production and one near Salinas, Monterey Co for summer
production.  We now have one consolidated year round growing facility in
Gilroy, CA, Santa Clara, Co.

It was produced in a sterile medium, using host plants to distribute the
inocula through carrier and then cultured until our propagule counts met or
exceeded the claims that are made on the label.  AM 120 stands for
"Arbuscular Mycorrhizae @ 120 propagules per gram".  Our lab counts are
generally much higher.

We will gladly forward you a sample for trials if you provide us with a
shipping address.

With respect to plant specific mycorrhizal associations within an endo
mycorrhizal community, that may be occasionally the case, but in general we
refer to most arbuscular mycorrhizal species as  *"Cosmopolitan"
and"Adaptive"*.  This means that organisms have the genetic potential to
express a different set of genes as necessary to adapt to different
environments and to form mutualistic associations with different plants.
That being said, some species just naturally do better from the get go at
higher or lower soil pH, etc.  Soils with varying chemical compositions
will influence the makeup of the plant communities above ground and the
types of microbes present below ground.  The biological makeup of most soil
is messy, influenced by edaphic conditions that are not well understood and
microbes are living in a continuous version of the *"Hunger Games"*.  For
this reason, we offer a multiple species approach as an option in soil
restoration.  In agriculture, landscaping and restoration projects that are
done on sites containing soil as opposed to parent material or mine
tailings, we recommend our single species *G intraradices 801*.

Why?  Because *G. intraradices* has been isolated on the Arctic Tundra of
the Canadian Northwest Territories, in the Amazonian jungle, the Sonora
Desert and the the Andes.  It is truly adaptive.  we have data that
demonstrates early germination and biomass benefits to several western
native plants.  It has also been used to grow the last eight world record
giant pumpkins (currently 2,058 lbs), the world's largest watermelon (350
lbs) and the world's largest tomato (8.4 lbs).  It leads the pack at
being *"Cosmopolitan"
and "Adaptive"*.

With respect to the DNA sequencing of the fungi, we work with the USDA /
ARS in Albany, CA and they have most of the "markers" necessary to identify
the more common species of mycorrhizal fungi.  The USDA / ARS in Peoria, IL
should have access to the same sets.  It will be interesting to see what
you find.  There are suggestions by some researchers that the Glomus genus
are mostly "pioneer" species and will be replaced by other species
overtime.  After seven years, it would be interesting to find out some of
these answers.  Good luck on your research.

Neil,

Thanks so much for the detailed answer -- this is VERY helpful. I'll be =
very interested to see if the "pioneer species" hypothesis holds up and =
whether the species that partner with G. intraradices are also the ones =
that have done best in the planting. I'll keep you posted!

You can send the inoculant sample to:

Jack,

Thanks for your message, and thanks for putting me in touch with Neil =
Anderson. I think I now have everything I need for the moment -- we'll =
be in touch when our sequencing results come back!=20

You'd be very welcome to come see the plots any time -- I'm hoping to =

drop me a line anyway! If your message to me bounces,  you can email our =
head technician Mike Masters (mmasters@illinois.edu) and he'll get you =
set up.

Thanks again,
Chris
