TITLE - "Lab-on-a-chip Method to Assess DNA Extraction Bias in Prairie Root Metagenomics"
ABSTRACT (from proposal, not included on poster)
  Next generation sequencing has created unprecedented opportunities to investigate interactions among plants and their associated microbial communities. However, estimates of community composition can be biased by differences in DNA extraction efficiency among species. Previous studies have shown that species diversity changes across serial extractions on the same sample. However, similar studies are needed for plants in order to account biased estimates of the endophyte and below-ground plant communities. Here, we are analyzing root cores collected from the University of Illinois Energy Farm, where plots of native prairie plants are being studied as potential sources of biofuels that also preserve natural communities and ecosystems. We make two mutually exclusive predictions: P1 – that the number of species recovered will increase with serial DNA extractions, vs. P2 - that there will be no differences in community composition across multiple extractions.  Using Agilent’s Bioanalyzer, we will gain estimates of changes in species diversity through analysis of DNA fragment length heterozygosity (LH-PCR) at taxon-specific genetic loci. Changes in length heterozygosity across serial extractions will indicate a need to increase the number of extractions per individual root/soil sample. Alternatively, no change in sample diversity will allow for substantial savings in time and materials. Accurately describing the composition of the interacting community is crucial to our understanding of plant health, species interactions, and ecosystem function, particularly in a changing climate.
  
BACKGROUND - notes/draft (will write more after a decent night's sleep)
  Looking at the ecology below ground in restored prairie fields
  Need to accurately assess the entire community and I am focusing on the microbial here
  Many extraction protocols have a natural bias and since we are working with mixed root samples across different locations and depths, we need to an extraction process that allows us to collect everything that is there. 
  I am looking at whether or not multiple extractions on the same sample increase our chances of collecting underrepresented species. 
  If so, this will allow us to eliminate much of the extraction biases and give us a more complete picture of the microbial community below ground.
  Characterizing soil microbes...
  This is a qualitative analysis.
  
MATERIALS AND METHODS
  Mixed root samples are from 4 random locations within each of 5 restored prairie blocks found at the Energy Farms here at UIUC. (Were there 8 samples from the largest block???)
  DNA from ground lyophilized root tissues was then extracted with a modified CTAB protocol (CHEN et al. 2004 ?), each four times (BJERKETORP et al. 2007). 
  The primers that we used were from the Earth Microbiome Project
  PCR conditions were from Scott
