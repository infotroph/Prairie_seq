In grasslands, root systems contain the majority of the total plant biomass and play a critical role by providing water to the plant in these generally water-limited systems. Because aboveground plant material is frequently removed by grazing and fire, roots and rhizomes also play an important role by storing nutrients (Heckathorn & DeLucia 1996). Despite the dominant role of roots in grassland systems, and the likelihood that different processes control aboveground and belowground community assembly (Price et al. 2012), studies of prairie plant community dynamics have generally focused on aboveground measures of plant dominance. Heterogeneity of soil resources has been postulated to be a primary driver of prairie community composition (Baer et al. 2005) (Get better citation -- Baer is testing more than postulating), probably because of resource partitioning between species (cite, probably Tilman) If this is the case, presumably changes in species composition are more likely to be driven by between-species differences in belowground, not aboveground, properties, and testing species dominance by assessing aboveground cover will tell an incomplete story. 

(that paragraph got very community-assembly heavy. Edit to move back toward resource partitioning.)


To better understand the dynamics of prairie species assemblages, we propose to directly asses the spatial distribution of root activity by collecting prairie root samples from a range of depths and characterizing the species composition of each sample through DNA extraction and multi-locus barcode sequencing as recommended by (Rewald et al. 2012). Because the site is highly fertile previously-tilled farmland, we expect that nutrient limitation and physical substrate heterogeneity are minimal, therefore predict that root community assembly will therefore mostly reflect plant water aquisition strategies. To test this hypothesis, we will combine sequence-based root abundance numbers with seasonal records of soil water and plant growth. If water availability is controlled by rooting strategy, the plants that are photosynthetically active at any given time should also be ones that have roots present in soil layers with available water (Does this prediction get causation right?).

In English:
	-- Whose roots are where?
	-- Expect reduced success for those whose roots aren't where the resources are.
	-- resource probably equals water

Sampling: Roots will be collected from a 5-year-old restored prairie at the University of Illinois Energy Farm, using a (bucket auger | hydraulic corer). Each sample will be taken to a depth of 1 meter, divided into (10 cm | 20 cm | 15-30-50-100 cm) increments, and immediately placed on ice. Samples will be transported back to the lab and washed the next day to remove soil, then the sample will be ground and DNA extracted (details to come: root-specific extraction protocol, etc):
	-- if straight-up barcoding: grind individual root segments, amplify barcode, ID. Sample paper: (Kesanakurti et al. 2011)
	-- Community sequencing: Grind all roots, sequence out, get relative abundance. Sample: (Price et al. 2012) did this but used presence-absence, but I don't see anything preventing their approach from giving abundance.
	-- Community FLP: (Frank et al. 2010)
	-- qPCR with species-specific primers: (Riley et al. 2009)


(Kesanakurti et al. 2011) sequenced rcbL from individual root fragments, not pooled samples. I think we're their "future workers": 
	"We did not attempt the other officially sanctioned barcoding region, matK (CBOL Plant Working Group 2009), because future workers may wish to use environmental samples of pooled underground material, for which multilocus species assignment may be impractical (in pooled samples, there may be no straightforward way of deciding which sets of loci comprise those from any single species). A main goal of our study was therefore to see how well a single locus can perform in identifying plants to species in this context."
