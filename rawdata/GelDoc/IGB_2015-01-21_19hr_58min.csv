# CTAB-BC buffer comparison: 6 species root vouchers
# Extracted 2014-01-19 by CRS. 
# (TLP extracted an identical set in parallel -- these are on gel imaged 2015-01-20 19:38.)
# 30 mg tissue, two samples from each species.
# Samples 1-7, "K30": Buffer uses 5% PVPP and 2% PVP40 (K30) as published.
# Samples A-F, "K90": Buffer uses no PVPP and 2% PVP360 (K90) instead of PVP40.
# Note: samples sat ~2 days at -20 °C before DNA was pelleted on 2015-01-21.
# Gel: 0.8% agarose with 0.01% ethidium bromide
# Loaded 10 µL sample + 2 µL loading dye per lane
# Ladder: 2 µL 1 KB + 2 µL loading dye
# Run at 75 V for 53 min
