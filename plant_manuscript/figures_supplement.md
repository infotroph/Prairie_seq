![Read counts obtained from water controls, binned by assigned genus. Each panel shows reads from a separate aliquot of DNA-free water processed simultaneously through the same DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing pipeline as the root samples. Notice that the y-axis shows raw read counts (not sample proportions as in other figures) and that the scale differs between panels.](figures/h2o.pdf){#fig:h2o_control}

![Genus identities of reads obtained from a mock community of DNA obtained from known-species root samples. Green dots show proportion of template DNA added to the mixture. Black bars show the proportion of reads obtained. Panels are technical replicates, each separately amplified and sequenced from the same aliquot of mixed DNA.](figures/mock.pdf){#fig:mock_control}

![Species identities of reads obtained from (top row) DNA extracted from single-species root samples, and (second two rows) DNA from the "*Andropogon gerardii*" sample spiked with 1%, 5%, or 10% *Elymus canadensis* or *Sorghastrum nutans* DNA. Notice that the barcoding assignment identifies the dominant sequence from the "*Andropogon gerardii*" sample as *Solidago*, not a grass!](figures/spikes.pdf){#fig:spike_control}

![Relative abundance (fraction of reads from each sample) as a function of sample depth for each observed plant genus. Sequences were clustered at 99% similarity and identified to species according to the closest BLAST match against the Genbank `nt` database. Taxa were then collapsed by genus and groups with a mean abundance less than 1% per sample were removed for plotting.](figures/genus_depth.pdf){#fig:gendepthrel}
