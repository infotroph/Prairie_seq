Yet we have little understanding of how drought structures grassland communities and the degree to which physiological drought tolerance advantages plants in grasslands. We characterized physiological drought tolerance ($\Psi$crit) for a large number of species in a mesic grassland community (Konza Prairie, KS, USA). We then examined the relationships between $\Psi$crit and a number of other key functional traits, and tested whether physiological tolerance of drought underlay success across a number of ecological contrasts---topographic position, burn frequency, and grazing---with 17 years of abundance data. Physiological drought tolerance of Konza species covered almost the full range known to plants globally. Consistently, physiologically drought-tolerant species had thin roots, while associations with other traits were inconsistent across functional groups. In this mesic grassland, physiological drought tolerance appears to increase the abundance of ...},

abstract = {Belowground vertical community composition and maximum rooting depth of the Edwards Plateau of central Texas were determined by using DNA sequence variation to identify roots from caves 5-65 m deep. Roots from caves were identified by comparing their DNA sequences for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the 18S-26S ribosomal DNA repeat against a reference ITS database developed for woody plants of the region. Sequencing the ITS provides, to our knowledge, the first universal method for identifying plant roots. At least six tree species in the system grew roots deeper than 5 m, but only the evergreen oak, Quercus fusiformis, was found below 10 m. The maximum rooting depth for the ecosystem was approximately 25 m. (18)O isotopic signatures for stem water of Q. fusiformis confirmed water uptake from 18 m underground. The availability of resources at depth, coupled with small surface pools of water and nutrients, may explain the occurrence of deep roots in this and other systems.},

Publicly available tools are needed to assemble overlapping paired-end reads while correcting mismatches and uncalled bases; many errors could be corrected to obtain higher sequence yields using quality information. PANDAseq assembles paired-end reads rapidly and with the correction of most errors. Uncertain error corrections come from reads with many low-quality bases identified by upstream processing. Benchmarks were done using real error masks on simulated data, a pure source template, and a pooled template of genomic DNA from known organisms. PANDAseq assembled reads more rapidly and with reduced error incorporation compared to alternative methods. PANDAseq rapidly assembles sequences and scales to billions of paired-end reads. Assembly of control libraries showed a 4-50% increase in the number of assembled sequences over na{\"\i}ve assembly with negligible loss of "good" sequence.},

abstract = {Sequence similarity searching is a very important bioinformatics task. While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications. We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site. The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications.},

abstract = {Replacing annual row crops with perennial grasses for bioenergy represents a landscape-level change in species composition, with the potential to impact annual soil nutrient removal on a regional scale. In this study we measured the concentration of ten essential nutrients in harvested material from three potential perennial bioenergy crops: Panicum virgatum L., Miscanthus giganteus, and a reestablished prairie to determine annual soil nutrient removals. We compared perennial bioenergy crops to nutrient removals by annual cropping systems of Zea mays L. (maize) and Glycine max L. (soybean) in Illinois. Crops were grown under management practices typical for the Midwest, US. In addition, we examined geographic variation in nutrient removal of M. giganteus at four US locations. Total removal of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Na, and Zn was significantly greater in maize than in any of the perennials. Removal of N, P, and K in M. giganteus was 3.7, 1.8, and 1.8% of the removal in maize, and 49.0, 17.4, and 31.9% of the removal in soybean respectively. At sites in Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, and New Jersey we found differences in N and K removal by M. giganteus that corresponded with differences in biomass. There was no effect of fertilization on M. giganteus biomass, but removal of N, S, and Mg increased and P removal decreased with increasing rates of urea fertilization. Cultivation of M. giganteus and switchgrass on land formerly used for row crops may reduce the need for nutrient additions and potential losses of nutrients to groundwater and the atmosphere.},
