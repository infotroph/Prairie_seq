## Abstract

The question of how diversity affects ecosystem resilience is urgent in the face of climate change, yet poorly addressed for belowground contexts. In particular, it is not clear to what extent different species change their behavior when grown in mixed root communities to achieve better partitioning of the available functional and spatial niches. In mixed root samples taken from varying depths in a tallgrass prairie restoration managed for biomass production, we identified taxa by using microfluidic PCR and high-throughput sequencing to obtain DNA barcodes for the *ITS2* region, and asked whether taxa from different functional groups had recognizable spatial roles or co-occurrence patterns. We found that grasses increased in prevalence with depth and forbs from the Asteraceae decreased with depth, and consequently that grasses and forbs showed negative co-occurrence (spatial segregation) overall. Most other taxa were found equally at all depths and showed random or positive co-occurrence, suggesting that there is little overall spatial partitioning at this site. Aboveground cover and belowground read abundance were positively correlated, but with a lower slope for grasses than for dicots. We suggest that in this managed, high-evenness system on uniform, fertile soils, the relatively small fraction of belowground biomass found in the form of grass roots in deep soil layers may be disproportionately important for functions such as water uptake, N leaching prevention, and C storage that affect the resilience of the whole ecosystem.
