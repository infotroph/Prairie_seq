## Summary

* The question of how diversity affects ecosystem resilience is urgent in the face of climate change, yet poorly addressed for belowground contexts. It is particularly unclear to what extent different species change behavior when grown in mixed root communities and whether the changes improve partitioning of functional and spatial niches. 

* In mixed root samples from varying depths of a tallgrass prairie restoration managed for biomass production, we identified taxa by high-throughput microfluidic PCR and sequencing of ITS2 barcodes, and asked whether taxa from different functional groups had recognizable spatial roles. 

* Grass prevalence increased with depth while forbs from the Asteraceae decreased, and consequently grasses and forbs showed negative co-occurrence (spatial segregation). Most other taxa were found equally across depths and showed random or positive co-occurrence, suggesting this site has little overall spatial partitioning. Aboveground cover and belowground abundance were positively correlated, but with a lower slope for grasses than for dicots. 

* We suggest that in this managed, high-evenness system on uniform, fertile soils, the relatively small fraction of biomass found as grass roots in deep soil may be disproportionately important for functions such as water uptake, N retention, and C storage that affect the resilience of the whole ecosystem.
