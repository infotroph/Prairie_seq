## Summary

* The ways diversity affects ecosystem resilience are central to climate change responses, yet poorly known for belowground contexts. In particular, it is unclear to what extent different plants change their rooting behavior in response to other taxa and whether these changes improve assemblage partitioning of functional and spatial niches. 

* In mixed root samples from varying depths of a tallgrass prairie restoration managed for biomass production, we identified taxa by high-throughput microfluidic PCR and sequencing of ITS2 barcodes, and asked whether roots from different functional groups had recognizable spatial roles. 

* Grass prevalence increased with depth while forbs from the Asteraceae decreased, making grasses and asters show negative co-occurrence (spatial segregation). Most other taxa were found equally across depths and showed random or positive co-occurrence, suggesting this site has little overall spatial partitioning. Aboveground cover and belowground abundance were positively correlated, but with less root per shoot for grasses than for dicots. 

* In this managed, high-evenness system on uniform, fertile soils, the relatively small fraction of biomass found as grass roots in deep soil may be disproportionately important for functions such as water uptake, N retention, and C storage that affect the resilience of the whole ecosystem.
