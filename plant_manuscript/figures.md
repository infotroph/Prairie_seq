![Correlation between percent aboveground cover (horizonal axis) and read proportion per root sample (vertical axis). Points are genus means for one experimental plot (N=5 plots); bars are 1 standard errors in each direction. Root proportions are averaged across all depths.](figures/agbg_genblock.pdf){#fig:abovebelowcor}

![Relative abundance (fraction of reads from each sample) as a function of sample depth for each observed plant family. Sequences were clustered at 99% similarity and identified to species according to the closest BLAST match against the Genbank `nt` database. Taxa were then collapsed by family and groups with a mean abundance less than 1% per sample were removed for plotting.](figures/family_depth.pdf){#fig:famdepthrel}

![Nonmetric multidimensional scaling plot showing centroids for all detected species. Red: Poaceae. Green: Asteraceae. Blue: Fabaceae. Black: Other families. Grey crosses: Low-abundance species, unlabeled for figure clarity. Pink ellipses show centroid SD for each depth and pink polygons show enclosing hulls for each depth. TK: Show depth, C, N as arrows instead.](figures/ordination.pdf){#fig:ordiplot}
