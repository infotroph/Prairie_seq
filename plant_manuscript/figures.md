![(a) total root mass of prairie plots measured in mid-August of 2011 [replotted from @AndersonTeixeira:2013bx] and 2014 (replotted from Black *et al*., submitted). Error bars show mean ± 1 standard deviation of 24 cores. Remaining panels show means of soil properties measured when the plots were established in 2008 [replotted from @Smith:2013cj]: (b) soil texture; (c) soil organic C and N content; (d) soil bulk density.](../figs/mass_texture.pdf){#fig:totmass}

![Correlation between percent aboveground cover (horizontal axis) and percent of reads per root sample (vertical axis). Each point shows mean ± 1 standard error for one genus in one experimental plot (N = 5 plots). Belowground read percentages are averaged across all depths. Separate regression fits are shown for dicot and monocot genera; shaded areas show 95% confidence bands for the line of fit.](../figs/agbg_genblock.pdf){#fig:abovebelowcor}

![Standardized effect sizes for observed co-occurrence rates. Each point is one pair of species; violin shapes show density distribution for each group. Vertical axes show family identity of the first species in the pair, panel labels show the family identity of the second species. Co-occurrence was defined as both species providing more than 1% of internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) reads from the same mixed root sample. Larger positive effect sizes indicate species pairs that are found together in more samples than expected for independently occurring species; negative values indicate pairs that are found together less than expected.](../figs/cooccur_effect.pdf){#fig:coeffect}

![Relative abundance (fraction of reads from each sample) as a function of sample depth for each observed plant family. Sequences were clustered at 99% similarity and identified to species according to the closest BLAST match against internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) sequences in the Genbank `nt` database. Taxa were then collapsed by family and groups with a mean abundance less than 1% per sample were removed for plotting.](../figs/family_depth.pdf){#fig:famdepthrel}

![Nonmetric multidimensional scaling plot showing centroids for all detected species. Each text label indicates the centroid for one species, identified by short species code and colored by family. Each cross indicates the centroid for a low-abundance species, colored by family but left unlabeled for figure clarity. Black arrows show best fits for environmental vectors of depth in soil, organic C and N content, and C:N ratio.](../figs/ordination.pdf){#fig:ordiplot}
