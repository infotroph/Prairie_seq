![(a) total root mass of prairie plots measured in mid-August of 2011 [Replotted from @AndersonTeixeira:2013bx] and 2014 (Replotted from Black et al., in prep). Error bars show mean Â± 1 standard deviation of 24 cores. Remaining panels show means of soil properties measured when the plots were established in 2008 [replotted from @Smith:2013cj]: (b) soil texture; (c) soil organic C and N content; (d) soil bulk density.](../figs/mass_texture.pdf){#fig:totmass}

![Correlation between percent aboveground cover (horizonal axis) and read proportion per root sample (vertical axis). Points are genus means for one experimental plot (N=5 plots); bars are 1 standard errors in each direction. Root proportions are averaged across all depths.](../figs/agbg_genblock.pdf){#fig:abovebelowcor}

![Relative abundance (fraction of reads from each sample) as a function of sample depth for each observed plant family. Sequences were clustered at 99% similarity and identified to species according to the closest BLAST match against the Genbank `nt` database. Taxa were then collapsed by family and groups with a mean abundance less than 1% per sample were removed for plotting.](../figs/family_depth.pdf){#fig:famdepthrel}

![Nonmetric multidimensional scaling plot showing centroids for all detected species. Red: Poaceae. Green: Asteraceae. Blue: Fabaceae. Black: Other families. Grey crosses: Low-abundance species, unlabeled for figure clarity. Pink arrows show best fits for environmental vectors of depth in soil, organic C and N content, and C:N ratio.](../figs/ordination.pdf){#fig:ordiplot}
