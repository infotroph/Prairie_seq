Sequences were clustered at 99% similarity and identified to species according to the closest BLAST match against the Genbank `nt` database. Taxa were then collapsed by family and groups with a mean abundance less than 1% per sample were removed for plotting.](figures/fam_depth.png){#fig:famdepthrel}
