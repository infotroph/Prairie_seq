In a rapidly changing world, one of the most pressing questions in ecology is which ecosystem properties promote stability and which lead to rapid state changes. It is now well recognized that diversity generally promotes resilience in ecosystem productivity [@Tilman:2001p114], partly through facilitation but primarily through functional complementarity that allows more effective partitioning and therefore more complete exploitation of niche space, producing a more stable overall allocation of resources across the community [@DeDeyn:2008hv; @Fornara:2008ja; @Fornara:2009ub].
This implies that the resilience benefits of niche partitioning will only be realized if different species in the community posess functions that are actually complementary to each other.
For example, N and water availability are often strongly anticorrelated in grassland soils, leading *Festuca ovina* and *Achillea millefolium* to extract N from different depths when competing in mixed-species stands than when they are grown alone, while *Phleum pratense* and *Trifolium pratense* showed no such vertical partitioning [@Jumpponen:2002eg]. 

In addition to functional complementarity, the resilience of grassland systems may rely on diversity in *spatial* partitioning as well. Prairie plant communities are noted for maintaining a large proportion of their biomass below ground [@jackson:1996gb], and the importance of belowground interactions between species with differing root traits for determining community productivity has long been recognized [@Weaver:1919wj; @Bardgett:2014jl].
Grassland plant communities may be more more strongly structured belowground than aboveground [@Kesanakurti:2011eg; @Hiiesalu:2012gt; @Wilson:2014iy] and the physiological capacity to exploit soil resources may be a strong predictor of competitive success [@Tucker:2011gf; @deKroon:2012gj; @Hendriks:2015ga].
Therefore, to understand the potential responses of multispecies communities to destabilized conditions such as a changing climate, it is necessary to understand the physical placement of the different species in the community as well as the between-species differences in resource allocation and niche partitioning strategies.

Progress in understanding these belowground dynamics is slowed by the challenges of studying belowground environments, especially for mixed-species samples. Because harvesting root systems requires digging and root systems show extreme spatial variability that increases the sample size needed to characterize a system, all methods are laborious and most require destructive harvests, often in the form of massive excavations to identify roots by physically tracing them to the plant crown [@Weaver:1950va]. Visual identification of roots based on anatomical or morphological characteristics is sometimes possible [@Wardle:2003dh] but is an inherently low-throughput method that requires a trained specialist and becomes much more challenging for very fine roots or highly diverse communities. Minirhizotron methods can provide some information on root placement, but have limited success at distinguishing between species [@Rewald:2012cm].

With the increasing availability of high-throughput DNA sequencing, molecular methods now provide a partial solution to this dilemma. DNA-based methods can use smaller samples and therefore less-destructive sampling techniques, allow distinctions between visually identical roots, and permit quantitative comparisons. Additionally, because DNA persists to some extent in dead tissue, sequencing potentially can integrate longer timescales by detecting species that are present in the community but were dormant or senesced at the time of sampling. The internal transcribed spacer between the 5.8S and 26S regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS2) is a popular choice for barcoding of mixed root species recovered from soil: It is easily extracted from all plant groups, widely used in root sequencing [@Jackson:1999vs] and therefore well represented in databases, and short enough (~200 bases) to sequence on an Illumina platform. Although higher taxonomic resolution can be obtained from multiple barcodes [e.g. *rcbL* and *matK*; @Staats:2016dg], assigning identities to multiple barcodes in mixed samples is challenging [@Rewald:2012cm] and ITS2 alone provides comparable resolution to other single barcodes [@Chen:2010il; @Fahner:2016dl]. 

The objective of this study was to identify the root species present at varying soil depths (0-100 cm) in a restored prairie in central Illinois, and to use these identities to infer differences in species roles for water usage, N uptake, and carbon storage. We used a DNA metabarcoding approach: we collected fine root samples by coring and extracted whole-community DNA for ITS2 amplicon library construction (Fliudigm Access Array) followed by sequencing (Illumina MiSeq 2x300), then identified the detected sequences to genus level by database search and compared the resulting abundance estimates against those from aboveground surveys.
