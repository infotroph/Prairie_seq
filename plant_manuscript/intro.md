## Introduction

Prairie plant communities are noted for maintaining a large proportion of their biomass below ground [@jackson:1996gb], and the importance of belowground interactions between species with differing root traits for determining community outcomes has long been recognized [@Weaver:1919wj; @Bardgett:2014jl]. Knowing the physical placement of different species in a belowground community is thus fundamental to understanding ecosystem functions. Existing evidence suggests that grassland communities may be more diverse and more strongly structured belowground than aboveground [@Kesanakurti:2011eg; @Hiiesalu:2012gt; @Wilson:2014iy] and that the physiological capacity to exploit soil resources is a strong predictor of competitive success [@Tucker:2011gf; @deKroon:2012gj; @Hendriks:2015ga], but it is not clear how universal these patterns are.

Progress in understanding these belowground dynamics is considerably slowed by the challenges of studying belowground environments, especially for mixed-species samples. Because harvesting root systems requires digging and root systems show extreme spatial variability that increases the sample size needed to characterize a system, all methods are laborious and most require destructive harvests, often in the form of massive excavations to identify roots by physically tracing them to the plant crown [@Weaver:1950va]. Visual identification of roots based on anatomical or morphological characteristics is sometimes possible [@Wardle:2003dh] but is an inherently low-throughput method that requires a trained specialist and becomes much more challenging for very fine roots or highly diverse communities. Minirhizotron methods can provide some information on root placement, but have limited success at distinguishing between species [@Rewald:2012cm].

With the increasing availability of high-throughput DNA sequencing, molecular methods now provide a partial solution to this dilemma. DNA-based methods can use smaller samples and therefore less-destructive sampling techniques, allow distinctions between visually identical roots, and permit quantitative comparisons. Additionally, because DNA persists to some extent in dead tissue, sequencing potentially can integrate longer timescales by detecting species that are present in the community but were dormant or senesced at the time of sampling. The internal transcribed spacer between the 5.8S and 26S regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS2) is a popular choice for barcoding of mixed root species recovered from soil: It is easily extracted from all plant groups, widely used in root sequencing [@Jackson:1999vs] and therefore well represented in databases, and short enough (~200 bases) to sequence on an Illumina platform. Although higher taxonomic resolution can be obtained from multiple barcodes [e.g. *rcbL* and *matK*; @Staats:2016dg], assigning identities to multiple barcodes in mixed sample is challenging [@Rewald:2012cm] and ITS2 alone provides comparable resolution to other single barcodes [@Chen:2010il; @Fahner:2016dl]. 

The objective of this study was to identify the root species present at varying soil depths (0-100 cm) in a restored prairie in central Illinois, and to use these identities to infer differences in species roles for water usage, carbon storage, and plant-microbe interactions by prairie plant communities. We used a DNA metabarcoding approach: we extracted fine root samples from soil cores bulked by depth and extracted whole-community DNA for ITS2 amplicon library construction (Fliudigm Access Array) followed by sequencing (Illumina MiSeq 2x300), then identified the detected sequences against those from a checklist of species known present from aboveground surveys.
