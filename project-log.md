Project log for the EBI prairie root sequencing project
===================================================

Started 2015-01-20 by CKB after project was well underway. For notes on previous steps, see paper lab notebook.

##Rules:

* This log is append-only, except when something earlier is wrong enough to warrant a correction, in which case the dated correction is INSERTED immediately after the error, with the original text left in place. 
* All entries start with date and author's initials.
* Try to include plenty of "why" in your entries--you'll end up documenting the "what" and "how" pretty well elsewhere, but this log is the first place to look when you see some previous work and say "What was I thinking? _Why_ did I do _that_?!" 
* Update as copiously or as tersely as you like, but update _as you work_ and don't pretend you'll come back to fill details "soon."

* Consulted with SAW on which controls we need for extraction, PCR, sequencing. Same approach I outlined in notes/controls.txt, details on PCR and sequencing to come later. Strategy for quantifying extraction efficiency: 3-4 replicate extractions of each root voucher with varying amounts tissue, regress mg tissue against Nanodrop yield. Take maybe the three highest- and three lowest-yielding species, make a FEW two-species root tissue spike-ins (e.g. a 15 mg sp. A, 15 mg sp B and a 25 A/5 B ) to show that total DNA recovery from mixtures is similar to what's expected from same amounts of tissue extracted in separate tubes. If spike-in yield is OK from a few pairs of species with very different DNA yields per mg root, seems reasonable to assume it's also OK from untested pairs whose DNA yield is similar to each other. 
* First pass at a script to convert gel images from linear-gamma tiff (i.e. completely black on my screen) to correct-gamma jpegs with automated lane annotation.
* Updated README.txt to explain gel image system
