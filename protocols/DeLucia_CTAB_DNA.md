CTAB extraction for prairie root DNA
DeLucia lab

Modified from: Brunner I, Brodbeck S, Büchler U, Sperisen C. 2001. Molecular identification of fine roots of trees from the Alps: reliable and fast DNA extraction and PCR-RFLP analyses of plastid DNA. Molecular Ecology 10:2079–2087.

Extraction buffer:

* 2% (w/v) CTAB
* 2% (w/v) PVP
* 100 mM Tris-HCL 8.0
* 25 mM EDTA
* 2.0 M NaCl
* 0.5g/L spermidine
* 5% (w/v) PVPP
* Add 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol just before using

Mix all but 2-mercaptoethanol and sterilize by autoclaving or filtering to 0.22 micron. If filter-sterilizing, do so BEFORE adding PVPP—it is water-insoluble and has a particle size of ~110 µm, so you'll just filter it back out. 

Step by step:

* Add 2-mercaptoethanol to extraction buffer and prewarm in water bath.
* Weigh out tissue: 30, 50, 70 µL.
* Mix 650 µL extraction buffer with tissue and invert to mix.
* Incubate for 30 minutes in 65 °C water bath, inverting tubes every 10 minutes
* Let cool 5 minutes
* Add equal volume (~650 µL) of chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24:1)
* Mix throroughly and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 10000g
* Remove the supernatant (~300 µL) and transfer to new tube
* Add equal volume (~300 µL) of chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24:1) to the previous supertanant
* Mix throroughly and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 10000g
* Add 1.5 volumes (~300 mL) of isopropanol
* Incubate overnight at -20 to precipitate DNA
* Centrifuge for 30 minutes at 20000 xg to pellet DNA
* Wash with 200 µL chilled 70% EtOH
* Let dry until pellets turn from white to clear
* Add 150ul TE, incubate on bench at least 30 minutes (for faster resuspension, can incubate 5 minutes in 65 °C water bath).
