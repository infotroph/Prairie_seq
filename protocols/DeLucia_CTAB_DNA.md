Day 1:

1. Measure enough extraction buffer for today's samples (1.3 mL per tissue sample), add 2-mercaptoethanol, and prewarm in 65 °C water bath.
2. Put in the freezer to pre-chill: One empty tube rack, at least 1 mL isopropanol per sample, at least 0.25 mL 70% EtOH per sample.
3. Weigh previously ground sample tissue into round-bottomed 2 mL tubes. For root tissue, use 15-45 mg and record exact weight in notebook. Keep tissue on dry ice and weigh *quickly* so it doesn't thaw during handling.
4. Mix 1300 µL extraction buffer with tissue and flick or vortex briefly to mix.
5. Incubate for 90 minutes in 65 °C water bath, inverting tubes every 10 minutes.
6. Blot water off the outsides of the tubes, then centrifuge 5 minutes at 10000 g. 
7. Remove 650 uL of buffer to a fresh tube. You now have two fractions from each sample: tube A contains buffer and tissue, tube B contains buffer and no tissue.
8. Add 650 µL of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) to each fraction.
9. Invert to mix throroughly and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 10000 g.
10. Pipet the supernatant into new tubes. Be sure to collect the entire top layer from every sample, but do not disturb the proteins at the interface layer.
11. Add 1 volume of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) to the previous supertanant. Calculate volume from the largest sample, probably ~600 µL.
12. Invert to mix throroughly and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 10000 g.
13. Combine the supernatant from both fractions into one 2 mL tube. Collect no more than 400 µL of supernatant from each fraction, but do not disturb the proteins at the interface layer.
14. Put tubes in a pre-chilled tube rack, add 1.5 volumes of ice-cold isopropanol, and invert to mix. Calculate volume from the largest sample, probably ~800 * 1.5 = ~1200 µL.
15. Incubate overnight at -20 °C to precipitate DNA.
16. Put all chloroform/BME contaminated waste into correctly marked waste containers in the fume hood.

Day 2: 

17. Centrifuge for 30 minutes at 20000 g to pellet DNA.
18. Pipet off liquid, being careful not to disturb DNA pellet.
19. Wash pellet by adding and then removing 200 µL chilled 70% EtOH.
20. Turn tube sideways to let residual EtOH drain. Be careful not to let pellet slide out! 
21. Let dry until pellets turn from white to clear (probably 20-45 minutes).
22. Add 50 µL TE and incubate on bench at least 30 minutes or in 65 °C water bath for 5-10 minutes. 
23. Check that pellet is fully resuspended, flick once or twice to mix, and take a Nanodrop reading.
24. Put 10 µL of sample into a fresh tube. Add (Nanodrop reading - 10) µL of TE to make a 10 ng/µL working stock. For example, if Nanodrop reads 145 ng/L, add 135 µL of TE so that (145 ng/µL * 10 µL)/(10 µL sample + 135 µL TE) = 1450 ng/145 µL = 10 ng/µL. 
25. Store working stock at -20 °C, and high-concentration master stock at -80 °C.


Extraction buffer:

Reagent 			| [final] 	| [stock]	| for 100 mL
--------------------|-----------|-----------|------------
CTAB				| 2% (w/v)	| 			| 2 g 
PVP, K30			| 2% (w/v)	| 			| 2 g
Tris-HCL, pH 8.0	| 100 mM 	| 1 M		| 10 mL
EDTA				| 25 mM		| 0.1 M		| 25 mL
NaCl				| 2.0 M		| 			| 11.7 g
spermidine			| 0.5g/L = 3.4 mM	| 1 M		| 340 µL
ddH2O				|			|			| to volume
2-mercaptoethanol 	| 2% (v/v) = 280 mM |	14 M	| 2 mL

Mix all but 2-mercaptoethanol and sterilize by autoclaving. Add 2-mercaptoethanol immediately before using.
