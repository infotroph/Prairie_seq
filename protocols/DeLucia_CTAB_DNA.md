Modified from: Brunner I, Brodbeck S, Büchler U, Sperisen C. 2001. Molecular identification of fine roots of trees from the Alps: reliable and fast DNA extraction and PCR-RFLP analyses of plastid DNA. Molecular Ecology 10:2079–2087.

Day 1:

1. Measure enough extraction buffer for today's samples, add 2-mercaptoethanol, and prewarm in 65 °C water bath.
2. Put in the freezer to pre-chill: One empty tube rack, at least 0.5 mL isopropanol per sample, at least 0.25 mL 70% EtOH per sample.
3. Weigh previously ground sample tissue into 1.5 mL tubes. For root tissue, use 15-45 mg and record exact weight in notebook. Keep tissue on dry ice and weigh *quickly* so it doesn't thaw during handling.
4. Mix 650 µL extraction buffer with tissue and flick or vortex briefly to mix.
5. Incubate for 30 minutes in 65 °C water bath, inverting tubes every 10 minutes.
6. Let cool 5 minutes.
7. Add 650 µL of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1).
8. Invert to mix throroughly and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 10000g.
9. Pipet the supernatant into new tubes. Be sure to collect the entire top layer from every sample, but do not disturb the proteins at the interface layer.
10. Add 1 volume of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) to the previous supertanant. Calculate volume from the largest sample, probably ~400 µL.
11. Mix throroughly and centrifuge for 10 minutes at 10000g.
12. Pipet the supernatant into new tubes. Be sure to collect the entire top layer from every sample, but do not disturb the proteins at the interface layer.
13. Put tubes in a pre-chilled tube rack, add 1.5 volumes of ice-cold isopropanol, and invert to mix. Calculate volume from the largest sample, probably ~300 * 1.5 = ~450 µL.
14. Incubate overnight at -20 °C to precipitate DNA.
15. Put all chloroform/BME contaminated waste into correctly marked waste containers in the fume hood.

Day 2: 

16. Centrifuge for 30 minutes at 20000 xg to pellet DNA.
17. Pipet off liquid, being careful not to disturb DNA pellet.
18. Wash pellet by adding and then removing 200 µL chilled 70% EtOH.
19. Turn tube sideways to let residual EtOH drain. Be careful not to let pellet slide out! 
20. Let dry until pellets turn from white to clear (probably 20-45 minutes).
21. Add 50 µL TE and incubate on bench at least 30 minutes or in 65 °C water bath for 5-10 minutes. 
22. Check that pellet is fully resuspended, flick once or twice to mix, and take a Nanodrop reading.
23. Put 10 µL of sample into a fresh tube. Add (Nanodrop reading - 10) µL of TE to make a 10 ng/µL working stock. For example, if Nanodrop reads 145 ng/L, add 135 µL of TE so that (145 ng/µL * 10 µL)/(10 µL sample + 135 µL TE) = 1450 ng/145 µL = 10 ng/µL. 
24. Store working stock at -20 °C, and high-concentration master stock at -80 °C.


Extraction buffer:

Reagent 			| [final] 	| [stock]	| for 100 mL
--------------------|-----------|-----------|------------
CTAB				| 2% (w/v)	| 			| 2 g 
PVP, K30			| 2% (w/v)	| 			| 2 g
Tris-HCL, pH 8.0	| 100 mM 	| 1 M		| 10 mL
EDTA				| 25 mM		| 0.1 M		| 25 mL
NaCl				| 2.0 M		| 			| 11.7 g
spermidine			| 0.5g/L = 3.4 mM	| 1 M		| 340 µL
PVPP				| 5% (w/v)	|			| 5 g
ddH2O				|			|			| to volume
2-mercaptoethanol 	| 2% (v/v) = 280 mM |	14 M	| 2 mL

Mix all but 2-mercaptoethanol and sterilize by autoclaving. PVPP will settle out quickly; invert to mix before every use.
