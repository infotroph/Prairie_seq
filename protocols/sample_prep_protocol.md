## Separate roots from soil

* Day before sieving:
	* Calculate how many samples you'll process tomorrow.
	* Move that number of samples from the freezer to cold room. Do not thaw more samples than you will use. 
	* Record these samples in the logbook as "thaw".
* Day of sieving: collect one thawed sample from the cold room.
* Clean the sieves, collecting pan, and a root dish with ethanol and let dry.
* Knead the closed bag to break up large clumps. 
* Put on gloves. Spray them with ethanol and rub hands together until dry.
* Pour soil through stacked coarse and medium sieves. Shake gently and break up soil clumps with your fingers, and lift out roots as they become soil-free. The goal is to recover all roots, with no major soil clumps, as quickly as possible.
* Collect roots in the sterile dish as you go.
* Once all roots are collected, transfer them to 50-mL tubes. Don't overpack any one tube. 
* Label root tube(s) with sample ID and tube number (e.g. "1 of 3"). Place in -80 freezer.
* Mix the root-free soil well, collect a subsample in a 50-mL tube, label with sample ID and "BULK", and place in -80 freezer.
* Label a paper pag with the sample ID, collection date, and "Prairie Root BGMG".
* Transfer about one cup of the remaining soil into bag, and set aside to dry for elemental analysis.
* Record the sample in the logbook as "sieve", noting how many tubes of roots there were.

## Wash roots to recover rhizosphere soil

* Retrieve roots, either fresh from sieving or from the -80 freezer. Keep them on ice throughout the process.
* Add 25 mL sterile water to each tube and shake gently until all soil attached to roots is dislodged. 
* Use sterile (ethanol-washed) tweezers to transfer roots to a fresh 50-mL tube. Save the first wash water. 
* Add 25 mL fresh sterile water to roots and wash again. 
* Use sterile tweezers to lift roots and let excess water drip back into the wash tube.
* Check cleanliness of roots.
	* If roots are still very dirty (this is rare!), wash a third time. Save the water as before.
	* If roots are fairly clean, place them in a fresh tube. Label with sample ID and "ROOTS" and place in -80 freezer.
* Put conical-tube inserts (hole in the bottom) into the centrifuge rotor. Round-bottomed inserts look very similar except that they have no hole and will damage your tubes! 
* Combine all wash water. If it won't fit in one tube, centrifuge and combine pellets until it will.
* Centrifuge wash water at 6000 rcf and 4 °C until well-pelleted. Start with 6 minutes and adjust time as needed.
* Pour off the supernatant, save pellet. Label with sample ID and "RHIZO" and place in -80 freezer.
* Record sample IDs in the logbook as "wash".

## Sonicate roots to remove residual contaminants
* Fill the sonicator reservoir with tap water until it comes all the way to the top when the tubes are in place. You'll need to fill beyond the "operating level" mark -- be careful not to slosh anything over the edge.
* Turn the power on and set parameters as follows:
	* Set Temp: 22 °C
	* Sonics: 10 min
	* Degas: 10 min
	* Heat: Off
* Start the degas cycle by selecting "set degas" and then pressing "I/O".
* While the degas cycle runs, retrieve washed roots from the -80 freezer. Keep them on ice throughout the process.
* To ensure correct sample tracking without making new labels, line the roots up on ice and work strictly in order.
* Rinse the sonicator tubes & caps with ethanol, then with sterile water. 
* Use sterile tweezers to transfer roots into sonicator tubes.
* Add enough sterile water to cover the roots, and ensure that the contents of the tube are fully immersed in the sonicator bath.
* Place caps on sonicator tubes.
* Start sonics by selecting "set sonics" and then pressing "I/O".
* While the sonicator is running, rinse the sample tubes with sterile water.
* Check roots for cleanliness. There should be no visible soil remaining on the roots and a small amount of lysate coming off their surface. If necessary, run them for up to 5 more minutes.
* Use sterile tweezers to lift out roots, blot them dry on a clean Kimwipe, and return them to their original sample tube. 
* For samples with multiple tubes of roots, combine them all into one tube if possible. Tight packing is okay at this stage.
* Return tubes to freezer until ready to lyophilize.
* Record sample IDs in logbook as "sonicate".

## Lyophilize samples
* Be sure to reserve the lyophilizer before using it.
* From the freezer, collect a matched set of roots, soil, and rhizosphere from each of 12 samples, for a total of 36 tubes.
* Remove caps from tubes and discard. 
* Stretch Parafilm over the mouth of each tube, stab three or four small holes in each film, and return all 36 tubes to the -80 for at least 30 minutes.
* Place 5 tubes in each lyophilizer jar.
* **(More specific lyophilizer instructions here)**
* Once finished, cap each tube with another layer of Parafilm and store **(on shelf? In freezer?)** until ready to use.
* Record the sample IDs in the logbook.
